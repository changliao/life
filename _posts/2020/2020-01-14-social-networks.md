After almost one year, I still feel the pain of Google+ shutdown.
Like many others, I have been trying to find alternatives, but ended in vein.
None of existing social networks have the unique features provided by Google+:
Share content to only who youâ€™d like to share using Circle;
Collection allows you to be the only one to start a thread;
Community encourages everyone to engage.
Of course, these features are more than what I described above. For example, circles are dynamics, which means that you can change someone in the circle without changing the post, and the changes will be updated whenever they refresh the site. However, the other websites use Tag to achieve this, but there are static.

No one is even close to G+ so far.

FB is full of spam and ads. No way I will use it for content management;
Twitter had no circle nor community, and collection by hashtag is static;
MeWe is not open without registration, and it does not have collection. Page is not free. You only have close friend and public, that is just 2 circles;
Slack, Teams, etc. are not public as well.
Wechat, the Chinese social network, is also not public, does not even support desktop.
Blogger does not support circle;
Github page does not support circle and it is not really for social networks.
In the end, it might be better to be not loyal to anyone of them. Instead, use multiple services at the same time.

If you consider security, then there is a need to use a more secure service as well.
