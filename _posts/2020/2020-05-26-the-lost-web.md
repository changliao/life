The web as I know has changed so much that I started to miss the old Web 
2.0.<div> 
<div>I started to know the internet since around 2002, I got my email from 
Yahoo.<div> 
<div>Later on I started using Gmail around 2006, Twitter 2008.<div>I was among 
the first to test Google+, Google Wave.<div>I also use Reddit, Digg, 
Delicious, etc.<div> 
<div>As I always try to keep up with the trend, I also learned that the path 
we took is not always perfect.<div> 
<div>Internet, as I remember, is used to be a place for sharing and 
communication. I have met many great people online over the years.<div> 
<div>However, I also have noticed that more and more people are abusing 
internet: <div>Twitter is becoming a place for political insult. <div>IG is 
becoming a place to show-off.<div>FB is becoming a place for ads.<div> 
<div>The quality of information is dropping that it is getting hard to find a 
gem.<div>This is also true for scientific research. We have more and more 
journals, but quality researches are not proportional.<div> 
<div>We set the bar too low that this world is now filled with fake news and 
poor information.<div> 
<div>Most people do not pay attention to responsibility online as they 
advocate online anonymity. But anonymity means people can say whatever they 
want without taking responsibility. <div> 
<div>As people are taking advantage of the internet, we lack the regulators to 
govern.<div> 
<div>But there are also few players level up. For example, programmers' 
favorite website Stack Overflow is generally well regulated because it is a 
community-based service.<div> 
<div>I decided to reduce my usage of Twitter and other services that do not 
regulate user activities effectively.<div>In the end, a service that only help 
us to grow is a service we should use.
