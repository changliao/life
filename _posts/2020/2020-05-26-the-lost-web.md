The web as I know has changed so much that I started to miss the old Web 2.0.

I started to know the internet since around 2002, I got my email from Yahoo.

Later on I started using Gmail around 2006, Twitter 2008.
I was among the first to test Google+, Google Wave.
I also use Reddit, Digg, Delicious, etc.

As I always try to keep up with the trend, I also learned that the path we took is not always perfect.

Internet, as I remember, is used to be a place for sharing and communication. I have met many great people online over the years.

However, I also have noticed that more and more people are abusing internet: 
Twitter is becoming a place for political insult. 
IG is becoming a place to show-off.
FB is becoming a place for ads.

The quality of information is dropping that it is getting hard to find a gem.
This is also true for scientific research. We have more and more journals, but quality researches are not proportional.

We set the bar too low that this world is now filled with fake news and poor information.

Most people do not pay attention to responsibility online as they advocate online anonymity. But anonymity means people can say whatever they want without taking responsibility. 

As people are taking advantage of the internet, we lack the regulators to govern.

But there are also few players level up. For example, programmers' favorite website Stack Overflow is generally well regulated because it is a community-based service.

I decided to reduce my usage of Twitter and other services that do not regulate user activities effectively.
In the end, a service that only help us to grow is a service we should use.
