What if we do not have to be responsible for any car accident?
The world will be in chaos because all drivers will drive a monster truck or you may be hurt by someone else.

What is stopping us from driving recklessly? Life is one factor for sure.
For most of us, it's because car accident is costly, or the penalty of accident is too high.

In another word, it's the penalty of accident that force us to follow the rules.
Even in the busiest road is the US, drivers can adjust quickly to avoid any incident.

Now, what if we put penalty on carbon emission?
If we have to pay penalty for carbon emission, do you think we can reduce carbon emissions?

I think the answer is Yes.

But we need to be clear who is the source of carbon emission. For example, it is the driver or the gas provider?

Like in an accident, who is responsible, the driver or the vehicle? or maybe the car malfunction in the accident?

It would be reasonable to say the emission provider should be responsible. If you driver a Tesla, then we might reduce the carbon a lot except during the production process.

If set the penalty high enough, we will find a better direction.
