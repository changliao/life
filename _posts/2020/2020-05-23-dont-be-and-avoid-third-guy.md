I once read a funny story but worth some reflection on our real life.

Three guys are traveling in the desert. Tired, thirsty, lost, they suddenly found a magic staff and a magician showed up. He said, since you found me, I can make three wishes come true for each of you.

The first said, I want money, and I want more, last please send me back home.

The second guy said, I want a beauty, and one more beauty, send me home as well.

So only the third guy is left. He said I want a bottle of wine, and another one, last I want the other two guys back because I feel lonely.

That is the end of the story.
