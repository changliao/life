Many years ago, I wanted to launch a website called "考研118". Why? Because I spent quite a long time (longer than any course I took in undergraduate) in the classroom 118 to prepare my graduate school exam.

Basically, 118 is a symbol: it is a place I studied and reviewed many knowledge; a place I thought about a lot about past and future; a place I observed a lots of different people; a place I fought for because sometime you cannot even find an open spot; a place of comfort and satisfactory.

I never did launch the website of course. I found many favourite places like 118: the libraries in universities; the Starbucks near my gym...

Sometimes in your life, you just find a spot you really like to spend some time at.
No matter how crowd it might, how small or big it gets, you can just blend in and find your inner peace. You watch people come in and go. You occasionally had a conversation as well. And you gradually know some familiar faces.

And we moved on, finding the next sweet spot.
