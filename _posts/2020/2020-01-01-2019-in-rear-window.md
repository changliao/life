As 2019 is already history, here is my look back summary.
First we had a great time during the holiday, a road trip to to several national parks around Utah.
We hit Arches first,

Then we arrived at the Horseshoe bend

Later on, we went to the grand canyon:

Then Hoover Dam:

And Zion is amazing:

And Bryce was cold:

That is the trip!

Things in 2019 were not much different than those in other years. We just kept working hard and playing hard.

There are a few things changed my life style.
Because Google+ was shutdown, I changed my internet presence significantly.
The last chapter of my PhD work was published finally. It took more than 1000 days to finish the project and it might be my finest work.
Here are a few things I will keep in mind in the upcoming year:
Say No to things I am not interested;
Take care of life and family;
Keep working hard and reflection always.
