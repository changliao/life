I setup a simple home security camera system:

- [Netgear POE switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LHL1Q2Z?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_ZHDYQF7TTHQAYJN2VS33) ($50)

- [Monoprice Cat6 ethernet cable](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=14769) ($50)

- [Annke POE camera C500 (x2)](https://www.annke.com/products/c500) ($80)

- [Ethernet crimping tool](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TBMYBMT?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_DW5M34KS38MQXSXV1Y0Y) ($20)

- [Ethernet head](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098DXNGJH?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_BGKV6CCH4KC0SQQY536F) ($10)

- [TP Link WIFI extender](https://www.costco.com/tp-link-ax1750-wi-fi-range-extender.product.100675409.html) ($60)

- [Sandisk sd card (x2)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FCMKK5X?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_R30DZ19VFN3BJ6HXX1HS) ($50)

Total cost: $320

It is POE based, so you don't need to change battery every few months. 

The switch has 4 POE ports so would be enough for most residential.

The ethernet cable and the crimping tool is for 23 AWG, so it supports high electrical flow.
The tool is go-through, so it is easier to build the cable.
